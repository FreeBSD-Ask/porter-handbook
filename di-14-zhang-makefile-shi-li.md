# 第14章 一个简单的 port

这里是一个 **Makefile** 的样本， 可以用来创建一个新的 port。请确保删除所有额外的注释 (括号中的注释)。

所示的格式是推荐的变量排序、章节之间的空行等的格式。这种格式的设计是为了使最重要的信息容易被找到。我们推荐使用 [portlint](https://docs.freebsd.org/en/books/porters-handbook/quick-porting/index.html#porting-portlint) 来检查 **Makefile**。

```
[section to describe the port itself and the master site - PORTNAME
 and PORTVERSION or the DISTVERSION* variables are always first,
 followed by CATEGORIES, and then MASTER_SITES, which can be followed
 by MASTER_SITE_SUBDIR.  PKGNAMEPREFIX and PKGNAMESUFFIX, if needed,
 will be after that.  Then comes DISTNAME, EXTRACT_SUFX and/or
 DISTFILES, and then EXTRACT_ONLY, as necessary.]
PORTNAME=	xdvi
DISTVERSION=	18.2
CATEGORIES=	print
[do not forget the trailing slash ("/")!
 if not using MASTER_SITE_* macros]
MASTER_SITES=	${MASTER_SITE_XCONTRIB}
MASTER_SITE_SUBDIR=	applications
PKGNAMEPREFIX=	ja-
DISTNAME=	xdvi-pl18
[set this if the source is not in the standard ".tar.gz" form]
EXTRACT_SUFX=	.tar.Z

[section for distributed patches -- can be empty]
PATCH_SITES=	ftp://ftp.sra.co.jp/pub/X11/japanese/
PATCHFILES=	xdvi-18.patch1.gz xdvi-18.patch2.gz
[If the distributed patches were not made relative to ${WRKSRC},
 this may need to be tweaked]
PATCH_DIST_STRIP=	-p1

[maintainer; *mandatory*!  This is the person who is volunteering to
 handle port updates, build breakages, and to whom a users can direct
 questions and bug reports.  To keep the quality of the Ports Collection
 as high as possible, we do not accept new ports that are assigned to
 "ports@FreeBSD.org".]

[If it requires GNU make, not /usr/bin/make, to build...]
USES= gmake
[If it is an X application and requires "xmkmf -a" to be run...]
USES= imake

[this section is for other standard bsd.port.mk variables that do not]
 belong to any of the above]
[If it asks questions during configure, build, install...]
IS_INTERACTIVE=	yes
[If it extracts to a directory other than ${DISTNAME}...]
WRKSRC=		${WRKDIR}/xdvi-new
[If it requires a "configure" script generated by GNU autoconf to be run]
GNU_CONFIGURE=	yes
[et cetera.]

[If it requires options, this section is for options]
OPTIONS_DEFINE=	DOCS EXAMPLES FOO
OPTIONS_DEFAULT=	FOO
[If options will change the files in plist]
OPTIONS_SUB=yes

FOO_DESC=		Enable foo support

FOO_CONFIGURE_ENABLE=	foo

[non-standard variables to be used in the rules below]
MY_FAVORITE_RESPONSE=	"yeah, right"

[then the special rules, in the order they are called]
pre-fetch:
	i go fetch something, yeah

post-patch:
	i need to do something after patch, great

pre-install:
	and then some more stuff before installing, wow

[and then the epilogue]

.include <bsd.port.mk>
